		<h1>Tie-dye cushion covers by Krishna and Keahn</h1>

		<p> We made tie-dye cushion covers for the redwood organic fair. First we took raw cleaned cloth and boiled it in 1 is to 4 cups of vinegar and water for 1 hour. Then we tie-dyed it in in boiling turmeric water. After that we took it out and saw the tie-dye effect. Then last we got it stiched into a pillow cover. </p>
